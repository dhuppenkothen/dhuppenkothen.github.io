						<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p> I am currently a tenure-track researcher and <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/women-science-excel-wise" target="_black">NWO WISE Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.sron.nl" target="_black">SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research</a>, where I do research at the interface of astronomy and data science. I am also a Data Science fellow at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu" target="_blank">eScience Institute</a> of the University of Washington. </p>
<p>
I am particularly interested in how we can use modern statistical tools and machine learning methods to learn about the universe. With my students and collaborators, I currently work on a diverse range of topics, including period detection in asteroids and solar flares, statistical machine learning for outlier detection and Approximate Bayesian Computation for understanding systematic effects in X-ray telescopes. </p>

					</header>

<p> Within SRON as well as in my role as an organizer of <a href="http://astrohackweek.org/2018/" target="_blank">Astro Hack Week</a>, I am very interested in how we can facilitate communication and collaboration both within and between scientific communities, and how we can help scientists learn and use modern data science methods. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/17/1717196115" target="_blank">A paper</a> on that topic in the context of hack weeks as a model of data science education and collaboration was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 I currently co-lead (with Anthony Arendt at the UW eScience Institute) a project funded by the Sloan Foundation to design and evaluate interventions for virtual participant-driven events like hack weeks and unconferences.
</p>

<p>					
<p> Previously, I was the Associate Director for the <a href="https://dirac.astro.washington.edu" target="_blank">DIRAC Institute</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu" target="_blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a>, after three years as a <a href="http://msdse.org" target="_blank">Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow</a> at New York University's <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Center for Data Science</a>.
Before that, I completed a PhD thesis on <a href="#two">magnetar bursts</a> with 
Anna Watts and Michiel van der Klis at the 
<a href="http://www.astro.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy</a> of the University of Amsterdam. </p>
<p>
Please feel free to look around my website and <a href="#contact">say hi</a>! 
<br>I am also (very occasionally) writing a <a href="https://danielahuppenkothen.wordpress.com" target="_blank">blog</a> on things I find interesting. Currently it's mainly a log of my continued experiences in organizing hackathons, but I am hoping to branch out to other topics in the near future. I'd love to hear from you if you have any ideas, comments and suggestions on any of the posts. </p>

						<h2>(X-ray) Astronomy and Data Science</h2>
					</header>
					<p id="one_partone"> 



At the moment, I am particularly interested in the application of statistical methods and machine learning in astronomy, 
especially in time series data taken across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. 
While the physics questions asked of our data can be wildly different, the underlying data problems are often the same. For my 
PhD, I worked on finding periods in magnetar bursts, short flares of gamma radiation from highly magnetized neutron stars. These 
are some of the most extreme objects in the universe: they have the highest densities and strongest magnetic fields that we know of!
I am now applying many of the same methods (or new versions thereof) to entirely different problems, including asteroid time series 
and solar flares. 
				</p>

				<p id="one_parttwo">
My other interest lies in how we can use new computational techniques to help us mitigate the effect of the telescopes and detectors we use on the inferences we gather about astronomical sources. Whenever we observe an astronomical object, the telescope and the detector leave imprints on the data we gather, often in the form of noise or distortions. Some of these sources of noise and distortion we can measure in the lab, or calibrate once the telescope starts taking data, but this isn't true for all types of noise or distortion. For those where we don't know exactly what the detector does to our data, we need to take the effects into account during data analysis, or the results we get from the data will be biased. 
I am interested in finding new ways to help us make our data analysis better in the presence of difficult sources of noise or distortion and I am currently working on new techniques for two effects that affect X-ray detectors: dead time and pile-up.

				</p>

				<p id="one_partthree">
Finally, I also like to think about how we can help the astronomy community learn data science, and how we can use data science to help the community. With colleagues from UW Seattle, New York University and UC Berkeley, I co-organize <a href="http://astrohackweek.org" target="_blank">AstroHackWeek</a>, a five-day workshop that is a cross of a summer school and a hackathon. Typically, we organize 4-5 tutorials on data science-relevant topics from statistics, machine learning, open-source software development, data visualization etc., and leave the afternoons free for project work, brainstorming and collaboration building. With colleagues who organize <a href="https://neurohackweek.github.io" target="_blank">Neuro Hack Week</a> and <a href="https://geohackweek.github.io" target="_blank">GeoHackWeek</a>, we recently wrote <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/17/1717196115" target="_blank">a paper</a> about the concept of hack weeks and its place in academia. In the context of workshop organization, I also think about participant selection a lot, and am co-author of a software package called <a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy" target="_blank">Entrofy</a> that's aimed at making participant selection more equitable and transparent.

                                                <h2>Magnetar Research</h2>
                                        </header>
                                        
<p>
For my PhD thesis, the main focus of my research rested on magnetars. These are neutron stars--the ultra-dense remnants of 
some types of stellar explosion (supernova)--that have exceptionally strong magnetic fields: about fourteen orders of magnitude 
stronger than that of the Earth! Neutron stars are one of the prime target for studying nuclear physics at densities and pressures 
that we cannot produce on Earth. Similarly, because their magnetic fields are far stronger than anything reproducible in a laboratory, 
we can use them to study unique quantum field effects only believed to be in effect in fields this strong. </p>

<p>
In practice, I studied bursts and flares from magnetars. Once in a while, we see bright blips of hard X-ray light that only last 
for a fraction of a second. Over the years, we have gathered thousands of such blips (called recurrent bursts) from several of 
these magnetars. Very, very rarely, they also show extremely bright outbursts in X-rays called giant flares. These are so bright 
that they can swamp our X-ray telescopes with light, and the gamma-ray photons of one of them even caused a measurable depression 
in Earth's magnetic field! These giant flares are a treasure trove for studying neutron stars and dense matter physics, because 
during the course of a flare, we have seen the brightness vary in periodic patterns. These patterns are so telling that we believe 
they've been caused by star quakes: effectively, the entire solid crust (neutron stars have solid crystal crusts, unlike normal 
stars) twists and shakes, something we can measure in the light that we see. In the same way that geoscientists study the earth's 
interior by measuring the waves travelling through it during an earthquake, we hope to be able to study the interior of neutron 
stars by studying the waves during a star quake. </p>

<p>While we have measured these waves in giant flares, these flares are rare, 
so data is scarce. My main task during my PhD was to search for these waves in the much shorter recurrent bursts. This task 
is technically challenging, because the methods we have for finding them were not designed for that particular task. Here is 
a simple comparison: imagine standing at a still pond. When you throw in a stone, you will see the ripples the stone created 
in the surface. Now imagine standing at the bow of a ship during a storm, performing the same experiment. 
The sea will be churning, there will be large waves and peaks and troughs, and that will make seeing the ripples created 
by the stone much more difficult. Our methods were designed largely for situations analogous to the still pond. The magnetar 
bursts I am studying, however, are more like a stormy sea! Most of my PhD research was dedicated to making our methods work 
(or, in my case, use a new method!) in the latter case, which can not only be applied to magnetars, but to other bright bursts 
as well (for example gamma-ray bursts or solar flares). We did find waves in the shorter bursts in the end, which gives us 
more data points to constrain theoretical models. Besides, we are still working to make those methods better, and we have 
not finished the search yet, so there may be more to come in the future!

				You can find all of my code on <a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
				I am a lead developer for the software project <a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray" target="_blank">stingray</a>, which aims to make X-ray (spectral) timing methods widely available in well-tested, well-documented implementations.
				During my PhD, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/BayesPSD" target="_blank">BayesPSD</a>, a Bayesian model for finding periodic and quasi-periodic signals in fast transients. It is still available on GitHub, but you should probably use the more modern and well-tested implementation in Stingray instead.
				</p>
				<p>The code <a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/magnetron2" target="_blank">Magnetron2</a> is a collaboration with Brendon Brewer and a hierarchical model for decomposing time series into a superposition of simple shapes. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Together with Brian McFee, I am also working on a data science tool to aid organizers of events in participant 
				selection, e.g. for conferences and workshops, 
				called <a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy" target="_blank">entrofy</a>.

that many blogs, but if I remember one I like, it'll probably go on here as well.

						<h2>Not Work</h2>
					<p>
					In my spare time, I am most likely to be found <del>playing</del> tuning my harp(a <a href="http://salviharpsinc.com/HarpDaphneSeriesSalvi.htm" target="_blank">Salvi Daphne 47EX</a>). I play a lot of Irish folk music (a leftover from owning an Irish harp for a long time), and I like modern classical music a lot. When not practicing new pieces, I'll probably be out exploring my surroundings with my camera, with a strong focus on waterfalls and squirrels, depending on which I am more likely to encounter. You'll probably find the photos on this website updated periodically.
